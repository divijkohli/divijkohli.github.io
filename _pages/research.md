#### Abstract:
<p align="justify">
One in seven Americans carry medical debt, with $88 billion reported on consumer credit reports. In April 2023, the three major credit bureaus stopped reporting medical debts below $500. We study the effects of this information deletion on consumer credit scores, credit limits and utilization, repayment behavior, and payday borrowing. Using a machine learning model, we show that small medical debts are not meaningfully predictive of defaults, suggesting their deletion should have minimal effect on lending decisions. We test this prediction using two complementary research designs. First, a regression discontinuity analysis comparing individuals above and below the $500 threshold finds no direct benefits from the information deletion, ruling out small changes in credit access. Second, to assess indirect effects, we classify consumers based on whether their predicted default probability increases or decreases when debts are deleted. A difference-in-differences analysis comparing these groups before and after the 2023 policy change reveals no evidence of negative spillover effects. Finally, we show that larger medical debts (>= $500) are also not meaningfully predictive of default, suggesting that eliminating medical debts entirely from credit reports, as planned under a January 2025 decision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is unlikely to affect credit outcomes. </p>

#### Abstract:
<p align="justify">
Research on payment security and credit card fraud has been constrained by data
limitations. Exploiting a quirk of credit reporting, we identify credit cards exposed to
fraud in credit bureau data. Using a matched-sample difference-in-differences approach,
we find that lenders restricted credit supply to individuals exposed to fraud, while
consumer demand for credit leveled off post-fraud. We then study the impact of a
sudden U.S. government initiative promoting the adoption of more secure chip-enabled
cards. Following this intervention, lenders ceased restricting credit supply to fraud exposed
consumers. However, despite enhanced payment security, consumers continue
to reduce their credit demand after fraud exposure. Our findings suggest that improved
payment security mitigates fraud risks for lenders, but persistent consumer distrust
about payment security underscores the need for further policy innovations, such as
one-time passcodes for credit card transactions.</p>
