## Initiative:  
I have been involved with Indian Graduate Students Association at UIUC in the capacity of President. We’re a vibrant community of Indian graduate students on campus, fostering connections, and creating a shared space for meaningful interactions. Our mission is clear: to be your go-to platform for forging connections, providing valuable insights, and ensuring that your journey in this new chapter of life is nothing short of extraordinary.
